RAG Chatbot Project
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and FAISS for document retrieval, embedding, and question-answering with a large language model (LLM).

Features
Load Text: Load text data from a file.
Text Splitting: Split the loaded text into manageable chunks for processing.
Text Embedding: Use Hugging Face embeddings to convert text chunks into vector embeddings.
Vector Store Creation: Store embeddings in a FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
Document Retrieval: Perform similarity search to retrieve relevant documents based on a query.
LLM-based Q&A: Use a pre-trained LLM with a custom prompt template to answer questions based on the retrieved documents.
