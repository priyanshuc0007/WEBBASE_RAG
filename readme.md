# 🚀 **RAG Chatbot Project**

Welcome to the **RAG Chatbot Project**! This project demonstrates an innovative **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, combining the power of **LangChain** and **FAISS** for advanced document retrieval, embedding, and Q&A using a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.

## 🌟 **Project Highlights**

### 📚 **Load Text**
Easily load your text data from a file for further processing.

### ✂️ **Text Splitting**
Break down your text into manageable chunks for smoother processing and embedding.

### 🧠 **Text Embedding**
Leverage **Hugging Face** embeddings to convert text chunks into high-dimensional vectors for deeper analysis.

### 🗂️ **Vector Store Creation**
Create and store embeddings efficiently using a **FAISS index**, enabling lightning-fast similarity searches.

### 🔍 **Document Retrieval**
Perform accurate and fast similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant documents based on user queries.

### 🤖 **LLM-based Q&A**
Ask questions, and get insightful answers! The system uses a pre-trained **LLM** with a custom **prompt template** to provide contextually relevant answers based on the retrieved documents.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **LangChain**: Framework for LLM orchestration.
- **FAISS**: Library for efficient similarity search.
- **Hugging Face**: For powerful text embeddings.
- **Streamlit**: For user-friendly interaction (optional for future development).
